# David and Mern's Awesome Adventure

## Dependencies
This app was created and optimized for:
  - node v17.3.0
  - npm 8.5.2

## Getting Started
clone the repo using the `git clone` cli command

run `npm install` to install the required packages

run `npm start` to run the app on localhost

## Project Details

### Routing
Routing is managed by `react-router` and uses a `pages/[page_name]` directory system. Each module build should be contained within each `/[page_name]` directory.

### Components
This project utilizes the `@chakra-ui` modular component library and uses a `components/[Component_Name]` directory system. Try to reuse modules using the component library, expanding on them as needed by altering interfaces or using the spread operator.


*****************
# Default ReadMe

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
